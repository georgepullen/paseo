/**
 * Single vitest runner for the 2fado plugin.
 *
 * `paseo-plugin-helper/core` and `/lifecycle` alias to the helper *source*
 * instead of the published `dist`: the headless hooks and lifecycle registrars
 * resolve host dependencies through the shared `client/host` module, and each
 * published entry is a separate bundle with its own host state. Aliasing to
 * source gives tests the same single host instance the esbuild-bundled plugin
 * has in production.
 *
 * `/client` is intentionally neither aliased nor imported: the plugin composes
 * its UI locally in `client/host-ui.tsx` over the host SDK (#937).
