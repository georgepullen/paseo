/**
 * Single vitest runner for the top plugin.
 *
 * The existing `node:test` suites run unchanged through a small `node:test`
 * shim alias, and the JSX regression tests render the real pill path against a
 * stubbed React Native. The helper resolves through the workspace link to its
 * built `dist`, so tests exercise the same helper bundle the plugin ships.
 *
 * `paseo-plugin-helper/core` and `paseo-plugin-helper/lifecycle` alias to the
 * helper *source* instead: the helper's lifecycle registrars and headless hooks
 * resolve host dependencies (`getClientHost`, `initClientHelpers`) through the
 * shared `client/host` module, and the published `dist` builds each entry as a
 * separate bundle with its own host state. A test that calls `initClientHelpers`
 * from the core entry would never reach a separate lifecycle bundle's copy, so
 * surfaces would throw "used before initClientHelpers". Aliasing to source gives
 * tests the same single host instance the esbuild-bundled plugin has in
 * production.
